# 1D_NERE
This matlab program solves the 1D Non Equilibrium Richards Equation (NERE) in initially dry snow considering a water flux at the top boundary (can be modified) and afree-drainage boundary condition at the bottom.

In this program, snow is assumed homoegeneous and the snow density and grain size can be modified in the file, as well as somw model parameters.
